Rules: In nim, two players take turns removing matches set up in five rows.
On their turn, a player can remove any number of matches provided they all come from the same row. You can remove matches by clicking on them. 
The player who is forced to remove the last match loses. After pressing play, choose "Two players" to take turns playing with a friend, or choose "One player" to play against the computer.
